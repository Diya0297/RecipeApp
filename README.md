# Getting Started with Create React App

$$Project Description$$
Have you ever asked yourself, "What should I cook? Hmmm??? Should I just order chinese?". I ask this question to myself everyday and to solve this problem and practice some React.js skills I built a RecipeApp that helps me find some delicious recipe ideas and saves my time scrolling on youtube searching for recipes. This app gives me variety of recipe ideas and a full recipe details. If I like the recipe too much then I can also add it to my favourites. Isn'nt is great to have everything I wanted in just one app which not only save my time but also keeps my wallet happy. 

If you wanna explore my cute RecipeApp, feel free to :).
